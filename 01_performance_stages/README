# 01_performance_stages

Shows the performance stages of AMX, the observation off of which gatebleed is built

# Steps
- `make`
- `python3 ./get_rdtscp_data.py`
- `python3 ./plot.py <csv file that was generated in the previous step>`

The generated plot.png should look like the file plot_original.png

# Troubleshooting
This code is confirmed to work on RHEL 9.4 and Ubuntu 22.04 on a Sapphire Rapids CPU
We observed RHEL 9.5 has the highest latency  performance stages disappear but 3 distinct stages should still be visible
This code requires an Intel CPU with Intel AMX.
